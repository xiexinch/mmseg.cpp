# mmseg.cpp

Inference [MMSegmentation](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmsegmentation) models in pure C/C++.

## Features

- Plain C/C++ implementation based on [ggml](https://github.com/ggerganov/ggml), working in the same way as [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp)

### TODO

- \[\] Implement a simple FCN model then extend to other high accuracy algorithm.
- \[\] Add a quantization tool.
- \[\] ...
